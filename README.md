# GPGPU particles

A GPGPU exploration using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and GLSL.
Thanks to [@nicoptere](https://twitter.com/nicoptere)'s article, that got me started in the subject, and also the utility [GPUComputationRenderer.js](https://github.com/yomboprime/GPGPU-threejs-demos/blob/gh-pages/js/GPUComputationRenderer.js) from [@yomboprime](https://github.com/yomboprime) that eases the creation and management of data float textures.
